In this project we are going to build and deploy node-todo application through Jenkins pipeline
I have configured two Jenkins agents which are labeled as agent-1 and agent-2 
In the Jenkinsfile we are using parallel build job by which we will be running deployment of our dockerized application on both agents parallelly.
